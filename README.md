Would You Rather Project
This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

This game allows users to answer predetermined questions and add new questions.
A leader board tracks participation.
Users must login before being allow to use the system.
If a user tries to access a question via URL they are directed to the login screen and THEN back the question...
All other logins are redirected to the home page after succesfully choosing a user.


To install and launch this application:
'npm install'
'npm start'

app will be available at http://localhost:3000

NOTE : I am very frustrated that this class is out of date!
I modeled this app off the lesson 7 application. As a result of the out of date course material there are a couple of warnings/errors!
TWENTY SEVEN days ago I asked for MENTOR help on the ROUTING of lesson 7... NO REPLY!!!
I did "ask a peer" and got no help.
I sent an email asking for help and was refered back the "ask a mentor".
If you're going to have an out of date class and not respond to requests for help, I trust that these will not be held against ME!
